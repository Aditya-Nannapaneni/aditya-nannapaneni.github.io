      <description>Quick Introduction Regions obtained after clustering the latitudes/longitudes in the dataset   Problem Statement:
  Objective:
 At a given time and location in NYC we want to predict the number of pickups in a 10 minutes interval.    Constraints:
  Latency, we expect the ML model to give us the result in a few seconds. Imagine a senario where you are a cab driver in NYC, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t want to wait 5 minutes to see the number of pickups in the region surrounding your current location.</description>

      <description>Quick Introduction In this project we are given a dataset provided by Facebook which contains 2 features as shown below. I&amp;rsquo;ve modeled this data as a directed graph, where each row in the dataset corresponds to a connection(i.e presence of an edge) between a source node and a destination node. Here the nodes represent users in a social networking website like Facebook, Instagram and an edge represents whether they are friends or not / follow each other or not.</description>

      <description>Quick Intro: Given a dataset containing question id&amp;rsquo;s, 2 questions (text format) and a binary target variable we have to predict the target variable of new questions
   Target Variable Mapping     0 not duplicates   1 duplicates    Problem Statement:
 Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already been asked. This could be useful to instantly provide answers to questions that have already been answered.</description>
